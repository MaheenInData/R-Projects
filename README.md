# R Projects Repository

Welcome to my R Projects repository! This repository contains two distinct projects focusing on different aspects of bioinformatics and data analysis. Below you will find detailed information about each project.

## Projects

### 1. Apidae_Biodiversity

**Description:**
This project analyzes bee biodiversity data from the BOLD database. The goal is to compare bin richness between the United States and China and examine potential links between biodiversity and bee colony loss.

**Key Features:**
- Data analysis of Apidae (bee) biodiversity.
- Comparison of bin richness across different geographical regions.
- Examination of factors affecting bee colony loss.

**Usage:**
1. Ensure you have R installed and the required packages (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`, etc.).
2. Load the R script and run the analysis by following the instructions within the script.

### 2. Viral_Genome_Analysis

**Description:**
This project performs basic analysis of viral genome data, focusing on RSV. It includes calculating GC content and sequence lengths from FASTA files, plotting these statistics, and saving the results.

**Key Features:**
- Calculation of GC content and sequence lengths from FASTA files.
- Visualization of GC content and sequence length distributions.
- Saving plots and statistical results to files.

**Usage:**
1. Install the required R packages: `Biostrings` and `ggplot2`.
2. Update the path in the script to point to your FASTA files.
3. Run the R script to perform the analysis and generate plots.

## Installation

To use these projects, ensure you have R installed on your system. Install the required packages by running the following commands in R:

```r
install.packages(c("Biostrings", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))
```
